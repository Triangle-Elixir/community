# Community

## What is Community?

Community is an Elixir/Phoenix app that was designed primarily to run [Raleigh
Design]. Feel free to fork it and use it for your own community!

Right now it is very early MVP. Only the basic requirements are implemented and
a lot of "features" are handled manually.
